The dataset to plot ROC curves in Figure 3 and 4 of our paper are collected from CRISPOR paper [2]. 

The descriptions of this dataset can be found in Fig. 2 of the CRISPOR paper: "For each scoring method, shown are the True positive rate (TPR)/False positive rate (FPR) when classifying 143 validated off-targets with a mismatch count of up to four, one of the PAMs NAG/NGA/NGG, and a minimum modification frequency of 0.1 %.".
